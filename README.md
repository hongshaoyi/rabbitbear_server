RabbitBear Server
	Hi everyone, I am RabbitBear, a server programmer who works in the game development.
	I have used two server engine in my work. So this time I try to write a server engine by myself	so that it can improve my knowledge of server engine, and it can improve my program skills, too. It is not easy, I have to learn a lot of thing, but I will try my best to finish it.
	If you have some advise or more efficient codes, please tell me, thanks.
